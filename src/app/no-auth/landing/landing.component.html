  	  Avocado toast is expensive, but the best things in life are free. Authencado is an open source starter repo for Angular apps that use payments or authentication via email, Facebook, Google, or Twitter. It even comes with this parallax landing page and responsive template. And Andy Aioli would tell ya himself, "the more bruschetta the betta."

      Fork this exact web app, cut it in half, or if you can really dig it, eat it with a spoon. Steal this website, replace the colors and images, and then copy/paste your API keys. BOOM! New Web App! Tell ya boss to forget about it and go take a vacation. Like Ricky Rigatoni told me, "ya clients are gonna love ya, kid!"

  	  Juicy features save you from building the same systems twice. This includes forgot password, email confirmations, update account, guarded routing, lazily loaded feature modules, Stripe API support, Firebase integration, and yes, even this landing page. Like Tommy Tomato always said, "get outta here!"
